# Basic Blog Demo

A project to demo a basic blog site with `Posts` and associated `Comments`.

Built with NextJS, TypeScript, and Tailwind.

## Running it

Clone the project locally and run the build command:

```bash
# npm or yarn
npm run build
yarn build
```

This will query the API and generate static pages for the list of posts as well as a page for each.

Now, run the production build:

```bash
# npm or yarn
npm start
yarn start
```
